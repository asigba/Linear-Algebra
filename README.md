# Linear-Algebra

## This repo is a refresher about Linear Algebra needed for AI/ML engineering roadmap

## Linear algebar ia fundamental mathematical foundation for many machine learning algorithms. It provides the tools for representing and manipulating data, which is often presented as vectors and matrices.

## Key concepts like **eigenvalues** help in dimensionality reduction and **linear transformations** are crucial for task like data transformation and model training.
